Take control of your WordPress author URLs by customizing the default 'author' base to match your brand.

== Description ==

Change Author Base puts you in control of your WordPress author page URLs. The default WordPress author URLs (example.com/author/username) might not match your brand or website structure. Our plugin lets you change author URLs to something that fits your needs, like 'team', 'about-us', or any other custom base you want.
